The rise in cocktail culture, the increasing popularity of rum-based drinks in bars and restaurants, and the expansion of flavored rum product lines by major brands are key factors contributing to this growth. Moreover, as the global market for craft and artisanal spirits expands, flavored rums are benefiting from increased consumer interest in small-batch, unique, and premium products. The growing inclination towards premiumization, supported by rising disposable incomes, is also playing a vital role in propelling the flavored rum market forward.
